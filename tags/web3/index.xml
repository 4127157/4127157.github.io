      <description>In my previous post I said that I will talk about my thoughts on web3 and what I think it is, while this post is not that post, it is one of the posts that will build up to that post, whenever it happens. ( and I may just put my thoughts together through these in that one post as a summary )
Every disruption can be most concisely summed up by this &amp;lsquo;meme&amp;rsquo; format : &amp;ldquo;thing but ____ (blank)&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Some Background I have been deeply interested in technology, primarily, techspec. For those unfamiliar, &amp;rsquo;techspec&amp;rsquo; just means technological speculation.
This interest goes back for me over ten years ago when I started writing about technology and techspec on a blog that I had on Blogspot.
My mom wouldn&amp;rsquo;t give me any money to host my own site and I was still in middle school at the time. As such, I had thought that I should try to raise some money somehow through the internet to host my own website where I could run that blog.</description>
