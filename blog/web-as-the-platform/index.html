<p>Every once in a while there are discussions about making things cross-platform
or a big deal about it. Nowadays, this discussion is mostly limited to
poweruser stuff like feature rich photo editing softwares, video editors or
games.</p>
<p>A few years ago, there was a big concern about this but with the advent of
Electron and the Web as a platform becoming even stronger, a new race has
emerged that has the potential to put software innovation on a rocket ship.</p>
<p>The system-tied software seems like the old guard trying to catch up with the
cool kids while the web keeps growing at breakneck speed.</p>
<p>When the internet came about, people thought it was not going to be much more
than a glorified email, some people even thought that it was a fad. Some people
still think that the web, as a whole, is going to <em>crash</em>. (whatever that
means)</p>
<p>None of these, <em>concerns</em>, have proven to be true.</p>
<p>The web was due for a slowdown many, many times before.</p>
<p>While technologies like Wordpress came around. When Blogger was basically going
to kill websites. Squarespace was going to put all programmers out of business.
Free tools that generate websites were going to make everyone a Frontend
Engineer.</p>
<p>None of those things happened.</p>
<p>Sure, more people can now make a website.</p>
<p>A pretty cookie cutter website, like the one that you&rsquo;re probably reading this
article on, but they still cannot do anything <em>custom</em>.</p>
<p>If you go to any freelancing site, it doesn&rsquo;t take that long for you to come
across one business or another looking to port their Wordpress website to
something else.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t meant to be a diatribe against WP. I like WP and I think it&rsquo;s fine,
though, in my opinion, <a href="https://strapi.io/" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Strapi</a> is much more powerful and
much better for a long term solution.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is, the web <em>train</em> did not stop at these little concerns and
powered on.</p>
<p>While people out there are still looking for other people to make single page
websites for them, increasingly, companies - big and small - are developing
robust tools on the internet.</p>
<p>If you want proof that this is happening and that we will be seeing software
after software tools come out on the web (software-like is what I mean, like
the ones I alluded to earlier) then you don&rsquo;t need to look much farther than
what is happening in the PaaS boom.</p>
<p>SaaS was the obvious prequel to this, as if a signaling one.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more of a blaring alarm-like signal is WASM.</p>
<p>WebAssembly not only makes it possible - and this is all RIGHT NOW - to make
desktop grade software on the web, but has the <em>potential</em> to emulate an entire
OS right from the browser.</p>
<p>Is it a surprise that Google envisoned a whole OS based around a web-first
ecosystem? I mean, sure, they were early, but not without reason.</p>
<p>Eventually we will see full fledged games on the web too with the help of
WebAssembly. WebGL&rsquo;s advent already made it so even children that make their
first game in an engine like Unity can share it with the world on the web
without any need for anyone to download a file.</p>
<p>But, all praises - that I could go on endlessly about - aside, here&rsquo;s some
different kind of praises.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-this-actually-mean">What does this actually mean?<a class="anchor" href="#what-does-this-actually-mean">#</a></h3>
<p>Everyone wins. Literally.</p>
<p>What web allowed us to do when it came on, as a concept, was it saved us time
and effort. That is what every technology does and every technology wastes less
of our time and becomes more powerful with time.</p>
<p>Most of the features that used to be in luxury and powerful cars are now in
normal cars, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>With the web, you are platform independent.</p>
<p>You can use Linux, Windows, MacOS, an iPad, a phone.</p>
<p>It would not matter.</p>
<p>No one loses.</p>
<p>All that would matter for things that are more powerful or less, is if your
hardware can run it, we&rsquo;ll eventually get to the point where that matters less
and less for normal everyday users too as Moore&rsquo;s Law effect dries up and more
and more high power stuff is in a normal budget while industry takes up all the
dedicated cards and stuff.</p>
<p>You can choose whatever weird configuration to your taste. Whatever browsers
that you&rsquo;d like. Whatever input methods that you like to use and it will all
work flawlessly through the unified protocols of the web.</p>
<p>I personally see that alternatives to big time software would become a big
thing. Users would start to take their web privacy more seriously and control
more of what flows through to the internet from their machine. Cryptocurrencies
will perhaps take another form, they might be in a weird territory now, but
they&rsquo;re probably here to stay much like social media or video games.</p>
<p>And eventually, game consoles and dedicated hardware would become even less meaningful.</p>
<p>This would mean more datacenters to more parts of the world which probably
entails more connectivity, more informational exchange and best of all, all our
ambitious ideas with cloud software, cloud media and cloud gaming all coming to
life.</p>
<p>A lot of people assume that this means there will no longer be any ownership of
your machine. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true. I just think more stuff will be on the
web than it is now much like just because the notes that you take in class are
already in the books doesn&rsquo;t necessitate that note-taking becomes useless or
that no one does it.</p>
<p>Data archiving will probably become huge too as physical memory dies off for
more and more people and they realise that this isn&rsquo;t a permanent store that
they have in their computer.</p>
<p>As it is probably evident, I could write forever about this subject.</p>
<p>But its suffice to say that it&rsquo;s nothing short of a Gold Rush in the early
stages waiting to happen as if there was an invisible boundry to cross.</p>
<p>Perhaps an economic web alternative that creates exchanges right on the web? Perhaps
people at Meta are correct on some things, at least?</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t tell you the exact shape of it. Am I all in? You bet.</p>
